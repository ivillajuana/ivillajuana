## Hi there 👋
I'm Isaac Villajuana, an Electronics Engineer based on Mérida, MX.
I'm currently finishing my Master's degree and working on IoT related projects that use
microcontrollers, wireless sensor networks and ML/DL applications.

### Tools
My main tech stack is c/c++, python, micropython. I mostly use python libraries for ML/DL apps.
At the moment I'm learning how to do _edge computing_ using **TensorFlow**
